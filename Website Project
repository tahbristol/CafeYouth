This website uses Charity Advantage as a host. Charity Advantage uses it own content management system which doesn't allow for external css and js files to be linked in by users.
They only give access to what is between a <div class="container"> </div>  which makes up the main body of the page. What I did was pick their own responsive pre-made them, took out all content and replaced it with my own using inline styling. The hosting company does not
allow access to the head tags of the page and I know of know other way to force a linked external file like a stylesheet file or js file. So I just used inline
css and put my js scripts at the bottom of my content. 

This is still a work in process as of Feb 26th, 2017. However mostly what is left is to tweak and to see if I can do something with their integreated form on the contact page.
The website is here:   www.cafeyouth.org
